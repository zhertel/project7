			<h2>Political Qualifications</h2>
			<p>I have all of the qualities that any good leader of the free world needs. I am older than 35,
			I was born in Ohio, and I have lived in the United States for my whole life. Constitutionally,
			I am fully qualified for this position. Of course, I do have additional knowledge that makes me
			more suited than other candidates for leading this country. If there is one thing I have learned 
			from my business ventures, it is how to keep something doomed to failure from self-destructing 
			long enough to benefit from it. Additionally, over a year of running both a cult and a political 
			party has fine-tuned my skills at manipulating large groups to the point where mind-controling 
			a country should not be too difficult. Most other politicians can only ever mind-control about 
			50&#37 of the country at a time!</p>
