			<h1>The Cult of The Party Parrot</h1>
			<p>The creed of The Cult of The Party Parrot is very simple: include gifs of our Lord
			and Savior Sirocco in as many emails and text conversations as physically possible. By doing 
			this, we can spread His light and love across the planet. There are many different gifs of 
			our Lord, and there is likely one for any topic or any conversation.</p>

			<p>As you can see, the face of Sirocco, in any of the forms He takes, immediately brings
			happiness to all who view it. If we all share His image, as well as save His chosen parrots,
			the Kakapo, peace will be restored to the Earth.
			<p>Convert today and Sirocco&#39s feathery appendage will bless you with peace, happiness,
			and parties. Download His gifs today at
