			<h2>Goals For The First Year Of Presidency</h2>
			<div class="goalleft">
				<h3>Anti-Discrimination Laws</h3>
				<p>It is appalling that there are still entire groups of people in the US who are being
				discriminated against. I will devote as much time and resources as necessary while in 
				the Whitehouse to guarentee that nobody will ever again be mistreated just because they
				married a parrot!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="goalright">
				<h3>Reform Segregated Schools</h3>
				<p>Many refuse to believe that there is still segregation in our public schools, but it 
				is still a major issue that my family has personally had to deal with. My very own 
				children were not accepted into Kindergarden solely because of their species! This is
				not what Rosa Parrots and Macaw Luther King fought for!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="goalleft">
				<h3>Bolster Our Agriculture</h3>
				<p>With the recent drouts and storms across the country, our farmers are sure to be suffering.
				If they are not assisted soon, we may soon need to increase imports on many of the important
				food products, like bird seed.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="goalright">
				<h3>Improve Foreign Relations</h3>
				<p>The United States does not have as sturdy a relationship with certain foreign powers, and
				not allying ourselves closer with such nations could spell trouble for our nation, and the
				things we hold dear. That is why I must improve our relationship with arguably
				<strong>the</strong> most important foreign nation: New Zealand, home of the Kakapo
				parrots!</p>
