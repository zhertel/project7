			<p>The PCP is the major modern catalyst for happieness and parties in the United States.
			With PCP, the whole country will be able to see all of the colors of the parrots. We have
			a very simple policy: nothing is ever wrong with the power of memes. By applying memes to
			world issues, the world will, almost miraculously, become better. They will improve our
			country&#39s foreign relationships. Nobody would reject trade if memes are involved, and
			Kim Jong Un would have to be pretty evil to nuke a country with such dank memes. Civil
			afairs will also be much easier to solve if everybody is happy and partying. There is
			nothing that dank memes and PCP won&#39t be able to accomplish.</p>
			<p>Want some more information on how memes could help the country, as well as empower you
			spiritually? Learn more about
			<a href="thecult.html" class="link">The Cult of The Party Parrot</a>
			and consider joining the party!</p>
