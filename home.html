			<p>Hello, people of the United States of America! I am Sirocco Birdman, Pope and Party Master 
			of The Cult of The Party Parrot, and I will be running in the 2020 presidential election as a 
			candidate for a newly-formed party with eyes set firmly on a joyful future for this country: 
			the Parrot Cult Party. With the help of PCP, and Cult members across the internet, Americans 
			evrywhere will finally see changes for the better, and a country filled with hope, joy, and
			plenty of parrots.</p>
			<p>I was once lost, with nothing more than a multi-million dollar software company, a mansion,
			a garage full of sports cars, and lots of women, but no purpose in life. Then, one fateful
			day, in March of 2016, I was granted a miracle in the form of an e-mail from my secretary. In 
			between meaningless ramblings about the FBI and my taxes, she had attached a message from my 
			savior: a gif of a majestic rainbow parrot partying hard. It was right then and there that
			I decided to flee my empty life, change my name, and form The Cult of The Party Parrot. 
			Through my endevors, I met my loving wife Susan, a cockatoo from Petsmart, and since then
			we have adopted 2 beautiful parakeets.</p>
			<p>I was hesitant at first to announce my candidacy, considering the public is usually against
			cult activity, but after The Cult of Kanye West announced their 2020 candidate, Kanye West,
			I decided to throw my hat into the ring. With political instability and fears on the rise,
			now more than ever the US needs the light of our parrot lord.</p>
